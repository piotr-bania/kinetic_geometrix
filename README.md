# Kinetic Geometrix

## About
Welcome to Kinetic Geometrix, an interactive 3D web experience that brings geometric shapes to life with motion and energy. Our project is built using a modern tech stack that includes Next.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber, GLSL, and Blender, designed to create a seamless and immersive journey through a dynamic digital space.

## Features
- **Imported 3D Models**: Utilizing Blender, we've crafted detailed geometric shapes that are imported into our web scene.
- **Animation and Interactivity**: With React Three Fiber, we enable the user to interact with the shapes in real-time, creating an engaging user experience.
- **Advanced Visual Effects**: Leveraging the power of GLSL shaders, our project offers stunning visual effects that enhance the aesthetic of our 3D environment.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Next.js, Kinetic Geometrix is fully responsive and optimized for a variety of devices, offering a consistent experience across platforms.
